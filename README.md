## **Cybersecurity Specialist | Penetration Tester | Ethical Hacker**

I am a dedicated penetration tester and cybersecurity professional with over **2 years** of hands-on experience in ethical hacking and system security. My journey in cybersecurity has been fueled by a passion for identifying vulnerabilities and securing critical systems.

Since early **2023**, I have actively participated in **Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions** to refine my penetration testing skills and tackle real-world scenarios. I specialize in working with various systems, including CMS platforms like **WordPress**, and have successfully exploited and written a **PoC** of notable vulnerabilities such as **CVE-2023-2640** [OverlayFs](https://github.com/Ruhanyat-994/Pentest-Vault/blob/master/TryHackMe-Easy/OverlayFS/ctf-OverlayFS%20-%20CVE-2021-3493.md) and others. I am proficient in **External and Internal Penetration Testing** from a **Black Box Perspective**.

Currently, I am preparing for:
- **Hack The Box Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS)**
- **OFF-SEC Certified Professional (OSCP)**
