### MIAN AL RUHANYAT


##
ðŸ‘‹ I am a dedicated penetration tester and cybersecurity professional with over 1.5 years of hands-on experience in ethical hacking and system security. My journey in cybersecurity has been fueled by a passion for identifying vulnerabilities and securing critical systems.

Since early 2024, I have actively participated in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions to refine my penetration testing skills and tackle real-world scenarios. I specialize in working with various systems, including CMS platforms like WordPress, and have successfully exploited and written a PoC of notable vulnerabilities such as CVE-2023-2640 [OverlayFs](https://github.com/Ruhanyat-994/Pentest-Vault/blob/master/TryHackMe-Easy/OverlayFS/ctf-OverlayFS%20-%20CVE-2021-3493.md) and others. Know both External and Internal Penetration Testing from a Black Box Perspective.

I am currently preparing for Hack The Box Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS) and OFF-SEC Certified Professional (OSCP) certifications to further enhance my technical expertise and credentials.
